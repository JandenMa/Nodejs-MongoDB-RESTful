##A example to show the knowledge of Node.js, MongoDB and RESTful

This is a example about Node.js. 

In this demo, I designed it with the MVC pattern, and I used some middleware such as Express, Mongoose and Body-Parser. In addition, I used mLab Sandbox database to test.

Moreover, the example will show the CURD operations with RESTful principle.
